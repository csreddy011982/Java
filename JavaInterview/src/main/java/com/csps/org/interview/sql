To fetch even Numbered row: SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name % 2 = 0
To fetch odd Numbered row: SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name % 2 = 1
SELECT * FROM EMP1 INNER JOIN EMP2 ON EMP1.EMPNO=EMP2.EMPNO WHERE (EMP1.empno %2)<> 0
SELECT * FROM EMP1 INNER JOIN EMP2 ON EMP1.EMPNO=EMP2.EMPNO WHERE (EMP1.empno %2)= 0
SELECT * FROM Student WHERE student_id % 2 != 0;  --> odd rows
SELECT * from Student ORDER BY GPA DESC LIMIT 5;
SELECT * from Student ORDER BY GPA DESC LIMIT n-1,1;;
SELECT * FROM Student s1 WHERE 4 = ( SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT (s2.GPA)) FROM Student s2   WHERE s2.GPA >= s1.GPA); (determine the 5th highest
 GPA without using LIMIT keyword.)

CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
CHAR: Fixed-length character data type where the storage size is predefined.
 Trailing spaces are padded to reach the defined length.
VARCHAR: Variable-length character data type where the storage size depends on the actual data length.
 No padding of spaces is done.

 There are 5 types of tables present in MySQL.
 Heap table, merge table, MyISAM table, INNO DB table, ISAM table
 LENGTH is byte count whereas CHAR_LENGTH is character count.
 SELECT CHAR_LENGTH(column_name) FROM table_name;
 SELECT LENGTH(column_name) FROM table_name;
 How to get the top 10 rows?--> SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 0,10;
 the DISTINCT keyword allows for the removal of all duplicate records and the retrieval of unique records
 SELECT DISTINCT colu1, colum2  FROM table_name;

What types of relationships are used in MySQL?
There are three types of relationships used in MySQL.
One-to-one: Elements with a one to one relationship can be included as columns in the table.
One-to-many: One to many or many to one relationships both are same. It will occur when one row in a
table is related to multiple rows in different table.
Many-to-many: Many rows in a table are related to many rows in different table is called many to many relationship.

What is join? Tell different join in MySQL.
Joins are used to connect two or more tables. It returns only same values in all tables.
There are four different ways to join MySQL tables.

INNER JOIN: The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as the condition is satisfied.
This keyword will create the result set by combining all rows from both the tables where the condition satisfies i.e.
 the value of the common field will be the same.

LEFT JOIN: This join returns all the rows of the table on the left side of the join and matching rows for the
 table on the right side of the join. For the rows for which there is no matching row on the right side,
 the result set will be null. LEFT JOIN is also known as LEFT OUTER JOIN

RIGHT JOIN: RIGHT JOIN is similar to LEFT JOIN. This join returns all the rows of the table on the right side of the
join and matching rows for the table on the left side of the join. For the rows for which there is no matching
row on the left side, the result set will contain null. RIGHT JOIN is also known as RIGHT OUTER JOIN.

FULL JOIN: FULL JOIN creates the result set by combining the results of both LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN.
The result set will contain all the rows from both tables. For the rows for which there is no matching,
the result set will contain NULL values.
SELECT SUBSTRING(FIRST_NAME, 1, 3)  FROM Student;  --> first 3 character of the name

SELECT Student.FIRST_NAME,    Student.LAST_NAME,    Scholarship.SCHOLARSHIP_AMOUNT,    Scholarship.SCHOLARSHIP_DATE
FROM  Student INNER JOIN   Scholarship ON Student.STUDENT_ID = Scholarship.STUDENT_REF_ID;

What is a primary key? How to drop the primary key in MySQL?
A primary key in MySQL is a single field or a group of fields that are used to uniquely identify each record in a table.
A primary key cannot be null or empty. ALTER TABLE statement is used to delete a primary key from a table.

What is the main difference between the primary key and the candidate key?
The primary key uniquely identified each row of a table. only one primary key is available for a table.
A primary is also a candidate key.
Candidate key that can be used for all foreign key references.

 What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE commands in MySQL?
DELETE Command is used to delete rows from the table depending on given the condition.
TRUNCATE command is used to DELETE all rows from the table.
 DELETE command is a Data Manipulation Language command. TRUNCATE command is a Data Definition Language command.

A Foreign key is a field that can uniquely identify each row in another table. And this constraint is used to specify a field as a Foreign key.
That is this field points to the primary key of another table. This usually creates a kind of link between the two tables.

ACID-->
A transaction is a single logical unit of work that accesses and possibly modifies the contents of a database.
 Transactions access data using read and write operations.
 In order to maintain consistency in a database, before and after the transaction, certain properties are followed.
 These are called ACID properties.
