Explanation:

The Client makes an HTTP request(GET, PUT, POST, etc.)
The HTTP request is forwarded to the Controller. The controller maps the request.
 It processes the handles and calls the server logic.
The business logic is performed in the Service layer. The spring boot performs all the logic over
the data of the database which is mapped to the spring boot model class through Java Persistence Library(JPA).
The JSP page is returned as Response from the controller.

Spring Boot Layers
------------------
The spring boot consists of the following four layers:

Presentation Layer – Authentication & Json Translation
Business Layer – Business Logic, Validation & Authorization
Persistence Layer – Storage Logic
Database Layer – Actual Database
