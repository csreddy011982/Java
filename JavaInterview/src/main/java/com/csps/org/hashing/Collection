What is the difference between Collection and Collections?
----------------------------------------------------------
Collection	       Collections
Collection --> It is an interface.
Collections --> It is a utility class.
Collection --> It is used to represent a group of individual objects as a single unit.
Collections-->	It defines several utility methods that are used to operate on collection.
Collection --> The Collection is an interface that contains a static method since java8.
Collections--> The Interface can also contain abstract and default methods.	It contains only static methods.

Difference between Traditional Collections and Concurrent Collections in java
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We all know about  Traditional Collections ( i.e. List, Set, Queue and its implemented Classes) and Concurrent Collection
(i.e. ConcurrentMap interface, ConcurrentHashMap class, CopyOnWriteArrayList class etc).
In these two Collections, there are few differences like:

Most of the Classes which are present in Traditional Collections (i.e ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap etc) are
non-synchronized in nature and Hence there is no thread-safety.
But All the classes present in Concurrent Collections are synchronized in nature.
 Therefore In Concurrent classes, we dont have to take care about Thread-safety.
While Traditional Collections also have some classes (like Vector, Stack etc) which are synchronized in nature
 and Traditional Collections also have SynchronizedSet, SynchronizedList, SynchronizedMap methods through which we can
 get Synchronized version of non-synchronized objects. But these above Synchronized classes are not good
 in terms of performance because of wide-locking mechanism .Whereas Concurrent Collections classes performance are relatively high than Traditional Collections classes.
In the Traditional Collections, if a thread is iterating a Collection object and if another thread try to add new element in that iterating object simultaneously then we will get RuntimeException ConcurrentModificationException. Whereas In the above case, we will not get any Runtime Exception if we are Working with Concurrent Collections Classes.
Traditional Collections classes is good choice if we are not dealing with thread in our application. whereas because of the Concurrent/Synchronized Collection we can use multiple Threads which are dealing with Collections Object. Therefore Concurrent Collections are best choice if we are dealing Multiple Threads in our application.
