Difference Between ConcurrentHashMap and SynchronizedHashMap..?
ConcurrentHashMap is a class which implements the ConcurrentMap interface.
ConcurrentHashMap is thread-safe therefore multiple threads can operate on a single object without any problem
In ConcurrentHashMap, the Object is divided into a number of segments according to the concurrency level
By default, it allows 16 thread to read and write from the Map without any synchronization

Synchronized HashMap: Java HashMap is a non-synchronized collection class.
If we need to perform thread-safe operations on it then we must need to synchronize it explicitly. The synchronizedMap()
method of java.util.Collections class is used to synchronize it. It returns a synchronized (thread-safe) map backed by the specified map.
