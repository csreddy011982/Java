COLLECTIONS
A collection is an in-memory data structure that holds all the values the data structure currently has
A collection is eagerly constructed and elements can be added or removed
Collections doesn’t use functional interfaces using lambda expressions
They are non-consumable i.e. can be traversable  multiple times without creating it again.
Collections are iterated using external loops like   for, while


STREAMS
A stream does not store its elements. They may be stored in an underlying collection or generated on demand
Stream is like a lazily constructed collection and elements inside streams can’t be added or removed.
Streams uses lot of functional interfaces using lambda expressions
Streams are consumable i.e. to traverse the stream, it needs to be created every time.
Streams are iterated internally based on the operation mentioned like map, filter.
