INTERFACE WITH DEFAULT
----------------------
Interfaces with default methods can’t have a constructor, state and behavior
There is no chance for creating instance variables
Static and instance blocks are not allowed
They can be used to write lambda expressions if they have only abstract method inside them
Inside them we can’t override Object class methods

ABSTRACT CLASS
--------------------
Abstract classes can have a constructor, state and behavior
Instance variables can be created inside abstract classes
Static and instance blocks are allowed
Can’t be leveraged to write lambda expressions
Inside them we can override Object class methods
